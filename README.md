# Project Title

An Online recipe app 

## About Online Recipe App

I have created a RESTful API for an online recipe app using Express, Node, and MongoDB. 
 This Express app will be served up by a Node server running on port 3000,
 and it will be connected to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.  
 I have implemented the following endpoints:

GET  /api/recipes  — returns all recipes in database
GET  /api/recipes/:id  — returns the recipe with the provided ID from the database
POST  /api/recipes  — adds a new recipe to the database
PUT  /api/recipes/:id  — modifies the recipe with the provided ID
DELETE  /api/recipes/:id  — deletes the recipe with the provided ID

### Installing

this app is a backend project.
crone this repo:
$ git clone 

```
then inside the backend folder, do npm install

```

launch it by command node server or nodemon server
it will run in port number 3000


```
